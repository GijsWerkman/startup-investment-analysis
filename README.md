This repository contains the Python code, data, and presentation for a group project completed as part of the MScBA in Business Analytics & Management program at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. The project, undertaken for the Business Analytics Applications with Python course (February - April 2024), analyzed investment rounds and acquisitions of real startups from 1995 to 2014. Our goal was to develop a model to predict their total funding.

# Project overview
Our project was comprised of two main stages:
1. Data Engineering and Exploration: We cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, identified key trends and patterns, and created visualizations to communicate our findings effectively.
2. Predictive Machine Learning: We built and compared various models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Lasso Regression, Random Forests, and LightGBM, to predict total startup funding as accurately as possible.
   
# Files
This repository contains the following files:
- **Project data.7z**: This compressed file contains the original datasets used in the project. Decompressing it is necessary to run the code.
- **question1.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook focuses on data engineering and visualization tasks.
- **question2.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook explores the different modeling techniques used in the project.
- **Presentation.pptx**: This presentation summarizes the findings of our data analysis, including methodology, results, and conclusions.

# My contribution
Our project culminated in several robust predictive models, with Lasso regression emerging as the top performer on our evaluation metrics, supported by rigorous data engineering and exploration.
