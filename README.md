This repository contains the code and data used for a group project completed as part of the MScBA in Business Analytics & Management program (February - April 2024).

# Project overview
The project involved analyzing a real-world dataset in a group setting. We focused on two main aspects:
1. **Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualization**: We prepared the data for analysis, identified key trends and patterns, and created visualizations to communicate our findings.
2. **Model Building and Comparison**: We built and compared different models, including multiple linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, to uncover deeper insights from the data.

# Files
- **Project data.7z**: This compressed file contains the original dataset used for the analysis. Decompression is required to run the code.
- **question1.ipynb**: This script focuses on data engineering and visualization tasks.
- **question2.ipynb**: This script explores various modeling techniques for the project.
- **Presentation.pptx**: This presentation summarizes the findings of the data analysis, including methodology, results, and conclusions.  

# My contribution
I primarily contributed to the data engineering tasks (question1.py) and the implementation of the random forest model (question2.py).

# Results
For our code and presentation we received a grade of 8/10.
