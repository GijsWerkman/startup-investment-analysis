This repository contains the code, data, and presentation for a group project completed as part of the MScBA in Business Analytics & Management program (February - April 2024). The project, undertaken for the Business Analytics Applications with Python course, analyzed investment rounds and acquisitions of real startups from 1995 to 2014. Our goal was to develop a model to predict their total funding.

# Project overview
Our project was comprised of two main stages:
1. Data Engineering and Exploration: We cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, identified key trends and patterns, and created visualizations to communicate our findings effectively.
2. Predictive Modelling: We built and compared various models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Lasso Regression, Random Forests, and LightGBM, to predict total startup funding as accurately as possible.
   
# Files
- **Project data.7z**: This compressed file contains the original datasets used in the project. Decompressing it is necessary to run the code.
- **question1.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook focuses on data engineering and visualization tasks.
- **question2.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook explores the different modeling techniques used in the project.
- **Presentation.pptx**: This presentation summarizes the findings of our data analysis, including methodology, results, and conclusions.

# My contribution
I primarily contributed to the data engineering tasks within question1.ipynb, the Random Forest model in question2.ipynb, and the final presentation.

# Results
For our code and presentation we received a grade of 8/10.
